Installation Instructions for Ape Parameter Interface

Ape is supported on Linux, OSX and Windows. It was tested
on Scientific Linux 2.0, OSX 10.4 (Tiger) and Windows XP
with both VS7 and VS8 compilers.

Installing Ape under Linux/Mac OSX
The process is the standard UNIX source installation
process:

o ./configure
o make
o make install

Type ./configure --help to see configure options. The
usual behavior applies to --prefix etc. One option,
--with-readline, allows one to specify which version of
readline to use with Ape.

Notes on Mac OSX:
o Xcodes are required.
o By default, Ape uses readline, but some versions of OSX
  do not come with readline installed, even as part of
  Xcodes. If ape's configure fails to run because it can't
  find readline, use the --with-readline option either to
  tell Ape where to find readline or else to disable
  readline. If readline is disabled, however, file completion
  and memory will be disabled, which makes the interface
  much less fun to use.

Installing Ape under Windows
Two sets of Visual Studio project files are provided:
o In directory vs7 are Visual Studio 7 files (Visual C++.NET 2003).
o In directory vs8 are Visual Studio 8 files (Visual C++.NET 2005).
  - Note that in some cases VS8 fails to find the Platform SDK
    even if the SDK was properly installed. If this happens, edit
    the VS8 Project defaults to show it where to find the SDK.
